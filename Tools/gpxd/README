GOSC 2012 Philip Herron - Cython
--------------------------------

Pxd generation via the gcc-python-plugin. This tool now requires users to use
GCC 4.7 or greater.

GCC installation - instructions:
Download GCC

untar
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ ../gcc/configure --enable-languages=c,. --enable-plugin <--disable-bootstrap/--enable-gold>
$ make
$ make install

GCC-python-plugin
$ export $(CC)="gcc" # make sure its your new GCC
$ make
$ make install

NOTE: if you had to install your own version of GCC when you do sudo make install $(CC) will
install the python.so to possibly the wrong gcc location. Make sure the correct gcc is in your sudo $(CC)
and its not just using the system builtin alias to cc to your old gcc
